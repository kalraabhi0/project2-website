	 </header>
	 <main>
	 <p>Building good credit involves several key steps: First, always pay your bills on time, as payment history is a significant factor in your credit score. Second, keep your credit card balances low relative to your credit limits, ideally below 30%. Third, avoid opening too many new accounts in a short period, as each application can temporarily lower your score. Fourth, maintain a mix of credit types, such as credit cards, installment loans, and retail accounts, to show you can manage different types of credit. Lastly, regularly check your credit report for errors and dispute any inaccuracies to ensure your credit history is accurate.</p>
